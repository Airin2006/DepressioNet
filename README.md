# DepressioNet
A Machine Learning Framework for Depression Diagnosis based on resting-state EEG signal

This project aims to build a machine learning framework to detect sign of depression based on resting-state electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Multiple EEG features were extracted for analysis and were used as features of classification models. 

I also proposed an end-to-end neural-network-based model for depression detection called "DepressioNet". The model acheives 0.889 accuracy, 0.933 sensitivity and 0.844 specificity on test sample, overcoming the state-of-the-art EEGNet-8,2.
